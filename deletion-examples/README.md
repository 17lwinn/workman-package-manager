this shows you an example of the required scripts, if you don't put these in people can't
uninstall your package- and it'll be rejected

<b>list.txt</b>- put all your filenames associated in here
<br>
<br>
<b>uninstall.py</b>- script to uninstall files in list.txt

-------------

they MUST be in a folder which is called the package name eg. xent/uninstall.py
